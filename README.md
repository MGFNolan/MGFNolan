# Hi there! 👋

## 🧠 About Me
Creative at heart, logical in mind. I'm a software developer on the junior side of experience, who loves turning ideas into tangible software. My background spans a History & Creative Writing degree, seven years in sports data, and now crafting accessible web experiences. For me, coding is like being a child in a sweet shop - there's always something new to learn and build.

## 💻 What I have Worked With
**Frontend:** React, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Tailwind, SCSS  
**Backend:** Python, Django, Node.js, PostgreSQL  
**Tools:** Git, GitHub Actions, Jest, Playwright, HubSpot CMS, Wagtail  
**Focus:** Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), responsive design, clean code principles

## 🚀 Current Adventures
- Seeking my next role
- Building my portfolio with full CI/CD pipeline (project board & current draft are public!)
- Finalising the Hebden Bridge Chess Club website (currently at MVP stage)
- Strengthening my React and JavaScript skills
- Planning a snooker score tracking web app (once I'm settled in a role)

## 🎯 What Gets Me Excited
- Seeing work I have contributed to in the real world, being used by real people
- Making the web accessible to everyone - On one project, I tackled over 2,000 WCAG issues. I am always advocating for inclusive design
- Mentoring and knowledge sharing (ran a bi-weekly Tech Video Club and helped onboard new developers to projects)
- The endless learning opportunities in tech

## 🎭 Beyond the Code
- **Chess enthusiast:** 1700 rating on Lichess, regular at Hebden Bridge Chess Club  
- **Poetry writer:** Very much an amateur, but it is cathartic and creative 
- **Former sports data professional:** Seven years of project management, stakeholder collaboration, and two years of being a line manager
- **Accessibility advocate:** Passionate about building inclusive digital experiences
